This project is to explore a dataset from Kaggle containing the top chess players in the FIDE Chess Federation from August 2020. I wrote a Python script to read the data from the CSV file and create SQL INSERT statements. I wrote SQL scripts to create and populate a table containing all the players with the Grandmaster title. I also wrote a SQL script with queries that explore the dataset and highlight some interesting details. 
These SQL scripts were written for Microsoft SQL Server.
